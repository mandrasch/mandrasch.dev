<h3>Personal background</h3>

I discovered my joy for coding and web development as a teenager. After school I did a three year apprenticeship program to become a state-certified IT specialist in Berlin.

Afterwards I decided to study in the field of media pedagogy and social sciences at University of Magdeburg and Technische Hochschule K√∂ln. <!-- I also did some freelance projects as web developer while studying. -->

After graduation I worked as scientific employee in university projects in Cologne, dealing with topics like Open Education (OER) and Digital Inclusion.

In 2020 I decided to work fulltime as a web developer again while moving to Vienna, Austria. Many thanks to the agency gugler\* MarkenSinn, who made it possible for me to return to web development with a special focus on web accessibility and sustainable web design.

I am pleased that I can continue to promote digital inclusion through digital accessibility and the topic of climate protection through green coding in my roles as web developer.
