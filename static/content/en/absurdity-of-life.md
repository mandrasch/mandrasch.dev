# Absurdity of Life

Philosopher Christian Uhle states in his book [„What’s it all about? A philosophical journey into
the meaning of life"](https://www.fischerverlage.de/verlag/rights/book/christian-uhle-wozu-das-alles-9783596709472)
that questioning our existence is a totally healthy thing to do. Yet it doesn't happen often in our daily business.Where religions used to provide answers, there is now potential emptiness - which can be filled.

Why are we actually on this planet? Christian Uhle is trying to get to the bottom of this with the help of philosophy and science. One of his revelations: It's not one question, there are multiple. And - purpose does not always correlate with happiness.
